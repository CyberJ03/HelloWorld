<h1>My First Python Program</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this program, I wrote a Hello World first-time Python program in VS code with a twist. Creating this program helped me develop my understanding of Python and showcases my creativity by spicing it up and not just giving you the basic print statement displaying Hello World.
